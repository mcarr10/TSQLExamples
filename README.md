# TSQL Examples
The purpose of this repository is to provide examples of T-SQL for common problems and patterns.

## Motivation
Over time I have built up a library of links that have answers to common SQL questions.  Recently some of those links are no longer available.  This motivated me to create my own library of examples.

## How To Use
The examples are written for SQL Server.  Some examples will work with other databases.
